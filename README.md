<h1>My Portfolio</h1>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio.  This site was created to display my work.  It's continually being maintained and updated to display skills as a software developer, leveraging pure HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>

<b>Tech used:</b> Pure HTML, CSS

I designed this site with one theme in mind: simplicity.  I approached the site knowing that in 8 weeks I'd be interviewing at a company, and more important than design was showing a recruiter/hiring manager my passion, competency as a developer, and my depth in javascript.  As such, the highlighted "Portfolio" are is where most of my time is spent - building functionality. 

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

I've refactored this code a handful of times.  I've employed a time-boxed method of learning, where I'd simulate an ask to change the site, and give myself a short amount of time to "ship it".  As such, I'd have to return to the code to refactor - which lead to good learning points (see below).

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<ol>
<li>My mind is built for this.</li>
<li>Flexbox is a dream.</li>
<li>Planning is KEY.  I planned the structure early on, but not the content within the structure.  This lead to commits later.</li>
</ol>
