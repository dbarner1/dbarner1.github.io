					<h3>Self Assessment Monday, 2:00 -3:00.George Popham</h3>
					<p> At BSLC Humanities, History, Literature are all intended to be part of a cluster, each class reinforces and highlights the material from the other classes. However, sometimes this can be overwhelming and self-assessment hour is intended to help with this. We'll spend this hour going over our notes from class and isolating the biggest most important themes and ideas. We'll discuss the ways that history, society and politics influence and inspire the literature we read. In self-assessment hour we'll write summaries, flesh out our notes, and ask ourselves questions that anchor our knowledge and deepen our understanding of the material from other classes.</p>
