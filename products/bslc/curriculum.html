			<h2>We don't host your typical cookie-cutter classes. </h2>
			<h3> In fact, each class, and set of classes, is created with care.</h3>
			<h3> Here are the top 3 things you should know about our classes:</h3>

		<div class="curriculumModules">
			<div class="curriculumModule">
			<h2>#1 Our Classes Are Unique</h2>
			<p>The course offerings at BSLC are always in development and change frequently based on member demand and need. Check back with our listings often to see what our members are learning. Also, members are encouraged to make suggestions and request courses they would like to have.

			At BSLC, we do not have tests or grades, and we consider classes to be more of a jumping-off point than an end in themselves. A class is an opportunity for our members to work with others who share their interests and discover the subjects they are most interested in, the projects they would like to take on, and the skills they would like to build. Classes at BSLC place a strong emphasis on seminar-style discussions. They are intended to help members learn to be more self-directed and to carry on their learning outside the classroom. All members are advised to discuss their ideas and interests with their advisors, other members, and the staff and to explore ways to learn and develop skills independently.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="curriculumModule">
				<h2>#2 Every Class is Interdisciplinary</h2>
				<p>All classes at BSLC are interdisciplinary. The goal of learning is to arrive at an ever-expanding and growing understanding of the world and how it works. This understanding should include art, science, politics, religion, technology, and history. The Humanities class, for example, is just as concerned with technological and political developments that have had an effect on human society as it is concerned with philosophy and literature. Likewise, mathematics has had a huge influence on music and art. We always look for ways to make these connections and encourage our students to do the same.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="curriculumModule">
			<h2>#3 We Specialize The Program For Each Student</h2>
			<p>Many classes and workshops in the first two months of the session meet once a week. During these early weeks, we encourage students to visit and try out as many classes as they would like. Add/drop week happens during the last week of September. At this time, we encourage students to choose the classes they are most interested in and to clarify their weekly schedule. After add/drop week, classes may decide to meet more often and cover more material. Our members are not required to take any classes and are free to work independently if they wish. However, if students do want to work in study groups or classes, the instructors and other members of the class will expect consistent participation. After add/drop week, we encourage members to only attend courses they are likely to stay with until the end of the session.</p>
