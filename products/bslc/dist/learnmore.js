	["<h3>Our Philosophy</h3><p>At Bay State Learning Center we think that the best and most lasting kind of learning is self-directed learning. At BSLC each student has the opportunity to work with a mentor to design a specialized learning program to fit his or her own needs, strengths, and interests. In addition to personalized support and a regular schedule of optional classes, BSLC provides a safe, comfortable environment where students can work, socialize, and thrive free of the coercion and pressure of traditional school. BSLC serves all kinds of students from successful straight A students who are bored or uninspired, to students who struggle with the imposed structure of school, to students who are disengaged and uninterested in standardized course work. Some want a better outlet for their creative ambitions and others have a specific area or discipline they want to focus on but find that the demands of school displace their interests. BSLC is for kids who need an open, flexible environment where they can find the security and freedom to succeed without irrelevant demands, arbitrary standardization, and institutional uniformity. Students like this can learn more and significantly improve their lives by leaving traditional school behind, and BSLC can provide them the opportunity to do so.</p><h3>The Individualized Learning Plan</h3><p>Every mind is different, which means every education will be different. At BSLC we will work with each student to devise an individual education plan. Working with a staff mentor, each student will evolve their own plan based on their interests, passions, and abilities. BSLC staff will assist with discussion, advising, research and brainstorming to help find the best way to pursue the plan. BSLC will also provide the space, resources and support necessary to carry out the plan.</p><h3>Advising Meetings</h3><p>Each student will have a staff mentor who will help the student to achieve their goals. Staff mentors provide a variety of support services like arranging tutorials, tracking progress, and facilitating necessary community connections.</p><h3>Classes, Workshops, and Tutorials</h3><p>BSLC will offer a variety of courses, workshops, and tutorials from Monday - Thursday from 9:00 - 4:00. Look for our calendar page for initial offerings soon. Our core staff will teach many classes and workshops, but we will also draw on our extended staff of work-study students, volunteers, and interns. We have access to work-study students from Boston's many universities and colleges and have many flexible resources to meet student’s needs.  All classes are either conducted in small groups or individually.  Courses and workshops are based on the interests of our students and will change based on demand.</p><h3>Outings</h3><p>One of our core beliefs at BSLC is that learning doesn't just happen in a classroom. Field trips, outings and excursions of all kinds are a part of the BSLC experience. Boston is one of the most culturally rich places on earth and we take advantage of that.  When the weather permits, hikes, camping trips, rock climbing, bird watching, and volunteer conservation projects will also be among the activities students can choose to participate in. We think that engagement with our community and the world are a crucial part of the learning process.</p><h3>An Alternative Approach</h3><p>BSLC is a non-coercive environment for members aged 10-19; we think any learning of consequence must be self-motivated. There is a great deal of research to support this conclusion. We support and advise but we do not try to force or control. All of us in the core staff of BSLC have seen firsthand the negative impact coercive methods have on learning. Attendance at BSLC is voluntary and members are free to come and go throughout the day. The only requirements at BSLC are attendance at the weekly community meeting and to preserve the safe and welcoming environment by treating all staff and students with courtesy and respect.</p>"],

	["<h3>What About College</h3><p>There is a huge population of students in the United States that get into college without going to middle school or high school. In fact, most students who pursue non-traditional education get into college. There are many ways to get accepted to colleges and college admissions officers value home schoolers and students from non-traditional educational backgrounds for their initiative and self-motivation. Colleges have admissions procedures for students who have not attended high school. Colleges want intelligent, passionate, self-confident students, who can do college work regardless of whether or not they have been to high school. BSLC will provide support and all necessary assistance with the college application process.</p><h3>Ways to Transition</h3><p>Portfolio Keeping a well-documented portfolio of your work to present to college admissions officers is usually a successful method. Sometimes colleges will require the student to take a standardized test. At BSLC we can help with all aspects of this process. Community College   Many students at self-directed programs take community college courses as college freshmen and sophomores and then transition to a four year school for their final two years. This is an affordable and common way to transition to college. Often students take community college courses or audit university courses while also attending a self-directed learning center. They can draw on the support of the staff and community of the learning center while they get used to doing college level work and document their work for college admissions purposes. Other Sometimes students are accepted on the basis of interviews, entrance essays, and test scores. There are a variety of ways that non-traditional students have gained admission to college. We are in contact with admissions officers at local universities and consult them regularly. We will consider all options for those students who intend to go to college.</p>"],
