		["Public Speaking",["11:00-12:00pm"],["Adam Tierney-Eliot"],"In this course we will explore some of the basic skills necessary for public speaking and set them in the context of Aristotle's Rhetoric.

We'll spend this hour going over our notes from class and isolating the biggest most important themes and ideas. We'll discuss the ways that history, society and politics influence and inspire the literature we read. In self-assessment hour we'll write summaries, flesh out our notes, and ask ourselves questions that anchor our knowledge and deepen our understanding of the material from other classes."]
